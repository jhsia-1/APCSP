    <img src = "jacob.jpg" class="rounded-image">
    <p class="p">Hello reader! I could not express the sheer extent of the delight I'm experiencing as a result of you reading this! How bored you must be, yet so interested in my personal background! Considering the fact that you've taken the immense amount of effort it takes to navigate to this page and read up to this point, I'll begin my introduction without further ado. </p>	
    <br>
    <p class="p">I am Jacob Hsia, a student at Piedmont High School on the precipice of graduating. In the fall, I will be attending Washington University in St. Louis as a first-year undergraduate student. I love working with close-knit teams united under a compelling common cause, whether that be building a world championship robot, winning the North Coast Section Championships for tennis, helping underserved children get robotics education, providing healthcare to the needy, performing classical music in world-class symphony halls, or simply socializing. It is from this common cause, this team spirit if you will, that I derive my work ethic. Of the many things that interest me, learning about how the biological world works, sports, and learning new languages top the list.  </p>
